# Network Pong
Copyright 2012 Oscar Key, Jack Yuan, Will Kochanski  
Licensed under GPL v3. See below and COPYING.  
A single pong game which spans multiple pcs. Front end in pure JS with a node.js server.

Run the server on a machine: 'node server.js'  
Connect to the server on 80 using a canvas compatible browser from other machines.

**Important note:** there are currently bugs caused by the time it takes to initiate http requests so the ball sometimes jumps about. I will fix these at some point.
